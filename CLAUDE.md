## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - THINK ULTRA HARD

**MANDATORY**: For EVERY task in this project, you MUST:
1. **THINK ULTRA HARD** before taking any action - analyse deeply, consider all implications
2. **USE ALL AVAILABLE AGENTS** that are relevant to the task at hand
3. **LEVERAGE ALL MCPs** (Model Context Protocols) for enhanced capabilities
4. **COORDINATE MULTIPLE AGENTS** when tasks span different domains
5. **NEVER SKIP AGENT USAGE** when an agent could improve the outcome

### Required Agent Usage Patterns

- **UI Development**: ALWAYS use `ui-engineer-playwright` for component creation and testing
- **Database Changes**: ALWAYS use `supabase-database-architect` for schema design and optimization
- **Security Reviews**: ALWAYS use `security-compliance-auditor` for GDPR and security compliance
- **SEO Content**: ALWAYS use `seo-content-optimizer` for all content creation
- **Complex Tasks**: ALWAYS use `orchestration-manager` to coordinate multiple agents
- **Git Operations**: ALWAYS use `git-repository-manager` for commits and version control
- **Cross-Platform**: ALWAYS use `cross-platform-sync-engineer` when changes affect multiple platforms
- **Debugging**: ALWAYS use `code-debugger` for any errors or issues
- **Competitive Analysis**: ALWAYS use `competition-analysis-expert` for market research

## Development Workflow - THINK ULTRA HARD

### For Every Development Task:

1. **PLANNING PHASE** - Think Ultra Hard:
   - Analyse all requirements thoroughly
   - Consider edge cases and implications
   - Plan the optimal approach using multiple agents
   - Create comprehensive task lists with `TodoWrite`

2. **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE** - Use All Agents:
   - Deploy relevant specialized agents for each subtask
   - Coordinate agents using `orchestration-manager` for complex features
   - Test continuously with `ui-engineer-playwright`
   - Validate security with `security-compliance-auditor`

3. **OPTIMIZATION PHASE** - Maximum Performance:
   - Use `competition-analysis-expert` to benchmark against competitors
   - Deploy `seo-content-optimizer` for all content
   - Leverage `code-debugger` for performance bottlenecks
   - Ensure cross-platform sync with `cross-platform-sync-engineer`

4. **DEPLOYMENT PHASE** - Excellence Standards:
   - Use `git-repository-manager` for proper version control
   - Run `security-compliance-auditor` for final security check
   - Validate with `ui-engineer-playwright` across all browsers
   - Document everything comprehensively

### MCP Integration Requirements

**ALWAYS activate and use available MCPs:**
- IDE diagnostics (`mcp__ide__getDiagnostics`) for code quality
- Code execution (`mcp__ide__executeCode`) for testing
- Any project-specific MCPs that become available
- External service MCPs for integrations
