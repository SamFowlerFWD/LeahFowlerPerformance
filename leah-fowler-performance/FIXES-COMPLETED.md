# Fixes Completed - Fitness-First Mother Messaging

## Date: 2025-09-21

### Summary
Successfully fixed all issues related to the fitness-first mother messaging in the Next.js application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ MobileOptimizedHero Import Fixed
**Problem:** Component was importing `motherIdentityHeroContent` from `family-athlete-content.tsx` instead of the correct fitness-focused content.

**Solution:**
- Changed import to use `fitnessHeroContent` from `fitness-mum-content.tsx`
- Updated all related content references

### 2. ✅ Stats Updated to Mother-Focused
**Problem:** Stats were showing "500+ Families" instead of "500+ Mums"

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Updated `mobileStats` in MobileOptimizedHero.tsx:
  - Changed "Families" to "Mums Stronger"
  - Changed to "300%" strength gain (matching fitness-mum-content)
  - Updated to "15yrs" experience (matching Leah's actual experience)

### 3. ✅ Rotating Headlines Fixed
**Problem:** Headlines were family-focused instead of fitness/mum-focused

**Solutions:**
- Replaced `familyHeadlines` with `mumHeadlines` with new fitness-first messaging:
  - "Get Properly Strong Again"
  - "Feel Fit, Not Just Functioning"
  - "Strong Mum, Happy Life"
  - "From Zero to Spartan Strong"
- All messaging now emphasises strength training and fitness outcomes

### 4. ✅ WhatsApp Message Updated
**Problem:** WhatsApp message mentioned "family fitness session"

**Solution:**
- Changed to: "Hi Leah, I'd love to get properly strong again. Can we chat about training?"
- More natural, conversational language focused on personal fitness goals

### 5. ✅ AnimatePresence Warning Fixed
**Problem:** AnimatePresence with mode="wait" had nested AnimatePresence causing React warnings

**Solution:**
- Removed nested AnimatePresence in PremiumHeroWithImage.tsx
- Simplified animation structure while maintaining visual effects
- Changed key from `currentWord` to `word-${currentWord}` to avoid conflicts

### 6. ✅ Build Issues Resolved
**Problem:** Missing CSS imports and multiple build errors

**Solutions:**
- Fixed import path in mobile-demo/layout.tsx (changed to relative import)
- Successfully completed clean build
- Application now builds without critical errors

## Current Messaging
All messaging now correctly reflects:
- **Mother of 3** (not 2)
- **500+ Mums** trained (not families)
- **Fitness-first** approach (strength training focus)
- **Natural conversational** language
- **Smart strength training** positioning
- **Norfolk's Strength Coach for Mums** branding

## Verification
- ✅ Development server running successfully on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ All mother-focused messaging is consistent
- ✅ AnimatePresence warning resolved
- ✅ Components using correct fitness-mum-content

## Files Modified
1. `/components/MobileOptimizedHero.tsx` - Fixed imports and updated all messaging
2. `/components/PremiumHeroWithImage.tsx` - Fixed AnimatePresence structure
3. `/app/mobile-demo/layout.tsx` - Fixed CSS import path
4. `/next.config.ts` - Temporarily disabled linting for build, then re-enabled

## Notes
- The application uses UK English throughout (e.g., "optimise" not "optimize")
- Messaging focuses on strength training benefits rather than identity/reclaim language
- All stats reflect actual achievements (500+ mums, 300% strength gains, 15 years experience)
