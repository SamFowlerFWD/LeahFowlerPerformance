## Date: 2025-09-23
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
All UI/UX issues identified in the inspection report have been successfully fixed, except for WCAG colour violations which were intentionally preserved per user request (keeping brand colours #d4a574 gold and #87a96b sage).

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Horizontal Scroll on Mobile - FIXED
**Implementation:**
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to both `html` and `body` elements
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` class to body in layout.tsx
- Ensured all containers have `max-width: 100%`
- Added viewport width constraints globally

**Files Modified:**

### 2. ✅ Inconsistent Padding - FIXED
**Implementation:**
- Created standardized CSS custom properties for spacing
- Implemented 8px grid system with consistent spacing scale
- Applied uniform padding to cards and sections
- Added responsive padding variables

**CSS Variables Added:**
```css
--spacing-xs: 8px

--spacing-md: 24px
--spacing-lg: 32px
--spacing-xl: 48px
--spacing-2xl: 64px
--spacing-3xl: 96px
```

### 3. ✅ Z-index Hierarchy System - FIXED
**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive z-index hierarchy system
- Applied consistent z-index values across all layers
- Fixed overlapping issues between header, modals, and floating elements

**Z-index Scale:**
```css

--z-modal-backdrop: 400
--z-modal: 500
--z-popover: 600
--z-notification: 700
--z-tooltip: 800
--z-maximum: 999
```

### 4. ✅ Grid/Flex Alignment Issues - FIXED
**Implementation:**
- Added default alignment rules for all grid containers
- Applied consistent flex alignment
- Fixed gap inconsistencies
- Created utility classes for consistent alignment

### 5. ✅ Touch Targets Below 44x44px - FIXED
**Implementation:**
- Updated all interactive elements to meet 44x44px minimum
- Modified button, input, select, and textarea components
- Added global CSS overrides with !important for enforcement
- Applied minimum height to all form elements

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/ui/button.tsx` - Already had proper min-height
- `/components/ui/input.tsx` - Updated to min-height: 44px
- `/components/ui/select.tsx` - Updated trigger and items to 44px
- `/components/ui/textarea.tsx` - Already exceeds requirement (64px)

### 6. ✅ Missing Focus Indicators - FIXED
**Implementation:**

**Focus Styles:**
- Primary colour: #d4a574 (gold)
- Secondary colour: #87a96b (sage)
- Outline width: 3px
- Outline offset: 2px
- Added box-shadow for enhanced visibility

## Test Results

### Quick Verification Tests: ✅ ALL PASSED
- 20 tests across 5 viewport configurations
- No horizontal scroll issues detected
- Touch targets meeting 44px minimum
- Focus indicators working correctly
- Z-index hierarchy functioning properly

### Viewports Tested:
- Mobile (375x667)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Desktop Small (1024x768)
- Desktop Medium (1440x900)
- Desktop Large (1920x1080)

## Files Modified Summary

1. **Core Styles:**
   - `/app/globals.css` - Major updates with all fixes
   - `/app/layout.tsx` - Added overflow-x-hidden
   - `/tailwind.config.js` - Already had good configuration

2. **UI Components:**
   - `/components/ui/button.tsx` - Verified compliance
   - `/components/ui/input.tsx` - Updated min-height
   - `/components/ui/select.tsx` - Updated min-height
   - `/components/ui/textarea.tsx` - Verified compliance
   - `/components/ui/card.tsx` - Standardized padding

3. **Test Files Created:**
   - `/tests/ui-ux-inspection/verify-fixes.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
   - `/tests/ui-ux-inspection/quick-verify.test.ts` - Quick validation tests

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Always test new components** for 44px minimum touch target
2. **Use the CSS custom properties** for consistent spacing
3. **Follow the z-index hierarchy** when adding new overlays
4. **Test on all viewports** before deployment
5. **Maintain focus indicators** for accessibility

## Notes
- Brand colours (#d4a574 gold and #87a96b sage) were preserved as requested
- WCAG colour contrast warnings remain but were not addressed per user preference
- All fixes are backwards compatible with existing components
- Performance impact is minimal (CSS-only changes)

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Run quick verification tests
npx playwright test tests/ui-ux-inspection/quick-verify.test.ts

# Run comprehensive tests
npx playwright test tests/ui-ux-inspection/verify-fixes.test.ts
```

## Summary
All UI/UX issues have been successfully resolved through comprehensive CSS updates and component modifications. The fixes ensure better mobile usability, improved accessibility, and consistent user experience across all viewports while maintaining the existing visual design and brand colours.
