## The Problem Section

### Are You Operating at 60% of Your True Capacity?

Research shows that **87% of executives** operate at only 60% of their performance potential due to:

- **Energy Mismanagement**: Working harder instead of optimising energy
- **Decision Fatigue**: Making 200+ decisions daily without recovery protocols
- **Cognitive Overload**: Processing information without strategic filters
- **Stress Accumulation**: High pressure without proportional recovery
- **Leadership Dilution**: Presence scattered across too many priorities

### The Hidden Cost of Sub-Optimal Performance

Every day you operate below capacity costs you:
- **¬£1,000-¬£5,000** in opportunity value
- **2-3 hours** of productive time
- **40% reduction** in decision quality
- **Compound stress** that accumulates over time
- **Team underperformance** that mirrors your energy

**Annual Impact: ¬£250K-¬£2M in lost value**
