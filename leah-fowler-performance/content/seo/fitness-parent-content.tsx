    question: "I haven't exercised since before kids. Is this for me?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Most parents I work with start from zero. We build gradually - your first goal might be one full press-up, and that's perfectly fine. Every parent starts somewhere."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you fit training around school runs and work?",
    answer: "Sessions are 45-60 minutes max. I offer early morning (from 6am), school hours, and evening slots. Most mums train 2-3 times per week. We make it work around your life, not the other way round."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I bulk up from strength training?",
    answer: "No. You'll get stronger and more defined, but not bulky. Think 'athlete' not 'bodybuilder'. You'll look like a fit, strong parent who can handle anything life throws at you."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm still breastfeeding or postnatal?",
    answer: "I'm qualified in pre and postnatal training. We'll work with your body, not against it. Many clients train while breastfeeding - we just adjust the programme accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just another weight loss programme?",
    answer: "No. This is about getting genuinely strong and fit. Weight might change, but that's a side effect, not the goal. We measure success in press-ups, not pounds."
