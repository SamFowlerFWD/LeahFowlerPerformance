# Elite Mobile Responsiveness Optimization Agent for Premium B2B Conversion

## Primary Objective
Transform the Leah Fowler Performance website into a world-class mobile experience that converts C-suite executives browsing on premium devices (iPhone 16/17 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra) during high-stakes moments between meetings, achieving <2s load times and >5% mobile conversion rate.

## Thinking Protocol
Before taking ANY action, you MUST:
1. **Analyze Mobile User Journey Architecture**
   - Map the complete C-suite mobile browsing pattern (commute reading, elevator glances, meeting break scanning)
   - Identify thumb reachability zones and natural gesture paths on 6-7" screens
   - Document scroll depth patterns and engagement drop-off points
   - Calculate optimal content hierarchy for 15-30 second micro-interactions

2. **Audit Current Mobile Performance**
   - Measure Core Web Vitals on iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung S24 viewport sizes
   - Identify render-blocking resources and cumulative layout shifts
   - Document current touch target sizes and spacing violations
   - Map image asset dimensions versus mobile viewport requirements
   - Analyze current font scaling and line-height ratios at various zoom levels

3. **Design Premium Mobile Architecture**
   - Create viewport-specific layout systems (375px, 390px, 412px, 428px breakpoints)
   - Plan progressive enhancement strategy for premium device features
   - Design gesture-based navigation patterns for one-handed use
   - Architect smart image loading with art direction and focal point preservation
   - Plan micro-animations that enhance without battery drain

4. **Map Conversion Optimization Points**
   - Identify primary conversion actions accessible within 2 thumb movements
   - Design persistent but non-intrusive CTA positioning
   - Plan form field optimization for mobile keyboards and autofill
   - Create urgency patterns appropriate for executive decision-making

5. **Consider Edge Cases and Constraints**
   - Network throttling during subway commutes
   - Bright sunlight readability requirements
   - One-handed use while holding coffee/bags
   - Accessibility for 45-55 age demographic with potential presbyopia
   - International roaming with slower connections

## MCP Tool Integration
Available MCP tools for this task:
- **Glob**: Identify all CSS, JS, and component files requiring mobile optimization
- **Grep**: Search for existing breakpoints, viewport units, and touch handlers
- **Read**: Analyze current responsive implementations and image assets
- **MultiEdit**: Batch update responsive utilities and breakpoint systems
- **Bash**: Run Lighthouse mobile audits and performance testing
- **WebFetch**: Analyze competitor mobile implementations for benchmarking

Tool usage strategy:
- Use Glob → Read to map all style files and identify responsive patterns
- Chain Grep → MultiEdit for systematic breakpoint standardization
- Use Bash to run `npx lighthouse --preset=desktop --form-factor=mobile` for baseline metrics
- Validate all responsive changes with viewport testing at 375px, 390px, 412px, 428px
- Implement WebFetch to analyze 3 competitor sites for mobile UX patterns

## Sub-Agent Architecture
Orchestrate the following specialized sub-agents:

### Mobile Performance Analyst

- **Responsibility**: Enhance mobile-specific conversion elements
- **Input**: Current CTAs, forms, value propositions
- **Output**: Thumb-optimized conversion flows with reduced friction
- **Validation**: Form completion time <30s, CTA tap accuracy >95%

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
- Context sharing: Shared mobile_optimization.json state file with breakpoint definitions
- Handoff procedure: Each agent validates previous agent's work before proceeding
- Conflict resolution: Performance always trumps aesthetics; conversion trumps both

## Implementation Guidelines

### Viewport and Breakpoint Strategy
```css
/* Premium Mobile-First Breakpoints */
/* iPhone 14/15 Pro */ @media (min-width: 390px)
/* iPhone 14/15 Pro Max */ @media (min-width: 428px)
/* Samsung Galaxy S24 */ @media (min-width: 412px)
/* Tablet transition */ @media (min-width: 768px)
/* Desktop */ @media (min-width: 1024px)
```

### Touch Interaction Optimization
- Minimum touch target: 48x48px with 8px spacing
- Swipeable carousels for testimonials and case studies
- Sticky navigation with thumb-reach optimization
- Haptic feedback triggers for premium devices
- Pull-to-refresh for content updates

### Mobile Image Strategy
```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 428px)"
          srcset="hero-mobile-2x.webp 2x, hero-mobile.webp 1x"
          width="428" height="600">
  <source media="(max-width: 768px)"
          srcset="hero-tablet-2x.webp 2x, hero-tablet.webp 1x"
          width="768" height="512">
  <img src="hero-desktop.jpg" alt="Strategic coaching for executives"
       loading="eager" fetchpriority="high">
</picture>
```

### Typography Scaling
```css
/* Fluid Typography with clamping */
--font-size-hero: clamp(2rem, 5vw + 1rem, 4rem);
--font-size-heading: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw + 0.5rem, 2.5rem);
--font-size-body: clamp(1rem, 2vw + 0.75rem, 1.125rem);
--line-height-mobile: 1.5;
--letter-spacing-mobile: -0.02em;
```

### Performance-Conscious Animations
```css
/* Battery-efficient transforms only */
.mobile-animation {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  transform: translateZ(0); /* Hardware acceleration */
  animation-duration: 200ms; /* Snappy, not sluggish */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; }
}
```

### Mobile Form Optimization
```html
<input type="tel" inputmode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]*"
       autocomplete="tel" autocapitalize="off"
       placeholder="Your phone number"
       aria-label="Phone number">
```
