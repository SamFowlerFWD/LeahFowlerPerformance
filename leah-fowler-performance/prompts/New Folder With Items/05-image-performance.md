# Elite Image Performance Optimization Agent

## Primary Objective
Transform the Leah Fowler Performance website into a lightning-fast, visually stunning experience that loads in under 2 seconds despite rich imagery, maintaining Core Web Vitals in the green zone while delivering premium visual quality that impresses C-suite executives.

## Thinking Protocol
Before taking ANY action, you MUST:
1. **Performance Baseline Analysis**
   - Measure current load times, LCP, FID, CLS scores
   - Audit all 10 new images for dimensions, file sizes, formats
   - Map critical rendering path and identify image loading bottlenecks
   - Analyze network waterfall to understand loading sequence
   - Document current perceived performance issues

2. **Image Architecture Design**
   - Create comprehensive image loading strategy matrix
   - Design responsive image breakpoints based on viewport analysis
   - Plan format selection strategy (WebP/AVIF with JPEG/PNG fallbacks)
   - Map critical vs non-critical images for loading prioritization
   - Design placeholder and skeleton screen strategy for each image

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Design progressive enhancement layers
   - Plan browser compatibility matrix
   - Create performance budget for each page section
   - Design testing strategy across devices and network speeds
   - Plan rollback strategy if performance degrades

4. **Quality vs Performance Optimization**
   - Calculate optimal compression ratios maintaining visual excellence
   - Design art direction strategy for different viewports
   - Plan perceived performance enhancements
   - Create loading choreography for smooth visual experience

## MCP Tool Integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Image Optimization Pipeline
```javascript
// Create automated optimization pipeline
- Generate WebP and AVIF versions of all images
- Create responsive image variants: 320w, 640w, 768w, 1024w, 1440w, 1920w, 2560w
- Implement smart cropping for art direction on mobile
- Apply progressive JPEG encoding for fallbacks
- Use mozjpeg for JPEG optimization (quality: 85 for hero, 80 for secondary)
- Use WebP with quality: 90 for hero, 85 for secondary
- Implement AVIF with quality: 85 for hero, 80 for secondary
```

### 2. Advanced Lazy Loading Implementation
```javascript
// Intersection Observer with progressive enhancement
- Implement native lazy loading as baseline
- Add Intersection Observer for advanced control
- Use rootMargin: '50px' for just-in-time loading
- Implement priority hints for above-the-fold images
- Add loading="eager" for hero images
- Use fetchpriority="high" for critical images
```

### 3. Picture Element Strategy
```html
<!-- Responsive images with art direction -->
<picture>
  <source
    type="image/avif"
    srcset="hero-mobile.avif 640w, hero-tablet.avif 1024w, hero-desktop.avif 1920w"
    media="(max-width: 768px)">
  <source
    type="image/webp"
    srcset="hero-mobile.webp 640w, hero-tablet.webp 1024w, hero-desktop.webp 1920w">
  <img
    src="hero-fallback.jpg"
    alt="Leah Fowler Performance"
    loading="eager"
    fetchpriority="high"
    width="1920"
    height="1080">
</picture>
```

### 4. Preloading Strategy
```javascript
// Critical resource preloading
- Preload hero image in appropriate format based on browser support
- Use Link: rel=preload headers for critical images
- Implement resource hints: dns-prefetch, preconnect for CDN
- Add <link rel="modulepreload"> for critical JavaScript
- Use Priority Hints API for resource prioritization
```

### 5. Skeleton Screens & Placeholders
```javascript
// Progressive image loading experience
- Generate LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) as base64 data URIs
- Implement blur-up effect with CSS transitions
- Create SVG-based skeleton screens matching image aspect ratios
- Add subtle shimmer animation during loading
- Implement dominant color extraction for placeholder backgrounds
```

### 6. Performance Budget Implementation
```javascript
// Enforce performance constraints
- Hero image: max 150KB (compressed)
- Section images: max 80KB each (compressed)
- Total image weight per page: max 800KB
- JavaScript bundle: max 100KB (gzipped)
- CSS: max 30KB (gzipped)
- Time to Interactive: <3.5s on 3G
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s on 4G
```

## Success Criteria
□ Page load time <2 seconds on 4G connection (measured via WebPageTest)
□ Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5 seconds
□ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) <0.05
□ First Input Delay (FID) <100ms
□ Total image payload reduced by >60% without visible quality loss
□ All images loading with appropriate lazy loading strategy
□ WebP/AVIF adoption rate >85% for supported browsers
□ Lighthouse Performance Score >95 on mobile and desktop
□ Smooth perceived performance with no layout shifts
□ All images properly sized for their containers (no resolution waste)

## Failure Recovery Protocol
If errors occur:
1. **Immediate Recovery**: Revert to previous image implementation via git
2. **Diagnostic Protocol**:
   - Run performance profiling to identify regression source
   - Check browser console for loading errors
   - Validate image paths and format support
3. **Fallback Strategy**:
   - Ensure JPEG/PNG fallbacks work for all images
   - Implement progressive enhancement layers
   - Add error boundaries for image loading failures
4. **Escalation Procedure**:
   - If LCP >3s: Review hero image strategy
   - If CLS >0.1: Check image dimension specifications
   - If load time >2s: Analyze network waterfall
5. **Documentation**: Log all performance metrics before/after for analysis

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Responsive Preloading
```javascript
// Dynamically preload based on viewport
const preloadResponsiveImage = (imageSrc) => {
  const link = document.createElement('link');
  link.rel = 'preload';
  link.as = 'image';
  link.type = 'image/webp';
  link.imageSrcset = generateSrcSet(imageSrc);
  link.imageSizes = '(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw';
  document.head.appendChild(link);
};
```

### 2. Progressive Loading Queue
```javascript
// Implement priority queue for image loading
class ImageLoadingQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.loading = 0;
    this.maxConcurrent = 2;
  }

  addImage(img, priority = 0) {
    this.queue.push({ img, priority });
    this.queue.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority);
    this.processQueue();
  }

  processQueue() {
    while (this.loading < this.maxConcurrent && this.queue.length) {
      const { img } = this.queue.shift();
      this.loadImage(img);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Adaptive Loading Based on Network
```javascript
// Adjust quality based on connection speed
const getAdaptiveImageSrc = (baseSrc) => {
  const connection = navigator.connection;
  if (connection) {
    if (connection.saveData) return getLowQualitySrc(baseSrc);
    if (connection.effectiveType === '4g') return getHighQualitySrc(baseSrc);
    if (connection.effectiveType === '3g') return getMediumQualitySrc(baseSrc);
    return getLowQualitySrc(baseSrc);
  }
  return getMediumQualitySrc(baseSrc);
};
```

## Performance Monitoring Integration
```javascript
// Real User Monitoring for image performance
const observeImagePerformance = () => {
  const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
    for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
      if (entry.initiatorType === 'img') {
        analytics.track('image_load', {
          src: entry.name,
          duration: entry.duration,
          size: entry.transferSize,
          cached: entry.transferSize === 0
        });
      }
    }
  });
  observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['resource'] });
};
```

Think step-by-step through the entire solution before implementing any code. Leverage all available MCP tools for maximum efficiency and reliability. Validate every assumption against the actual codebase before proceeding. Ensure all code is optimized for Cursor's AI-assisted development environment. Document your reasoning at each decision point for future reference. Consider the broader system impact of every change, especially on Core Web Vitals and user experience.
