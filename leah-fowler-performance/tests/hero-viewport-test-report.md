# Hero Section Viewport Test Report

## Test Results Summary

Screenshots have been captured at three viewport sizes to verify the tablet view fix.

### Mobile View (375px) ✅
- **Layout Type**: OVERLAY
- **Image Position**: Behind text (absolute positioning)
- **Heading Font Size**: 38px
- **Status**: Working as expected
- **Description**: Text content is overlaid on top of the hero image with proper contrast

### Tablet View (768px) ⚠️ ISSUE DETECTED
- **Layout Type**: Text only, no visible image
- **Image Position**: Not visible in viewport
- **Heading Font Size**: 96px (TOO LARGE)
- **Status**: NOT working as expected
- **Issues Identified**:
  1. Image is not visible - appears to be positioned off-screen
  2. Font size is too large (96px) - should be smaller for tablet
  3. Layout is not side-by-side as intended
  4. Only showing text content with dark background

### Desktop View (1440px) ✅
- **Layout Type**: SIDE-BY-SIDE (flex)
- **Image Position**: Right side of screen
- **Heading Font Size**: 48px
- **Status**: Working as expected
- **Description**: Text on left, image on right in a flex container

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Tablet View (768px) Problems:
- **Missing Image**: The hero image is not visible at tablet breakpoint
- **Font Size**: Heading is 96px (way too large for tablet)
- **Layout**: Should be side-by-side but showing only text

## Expected Behavior

- **Mobile (< 640px)**: Overlay layout with text over image ✅
- **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**: Side-by-side layout with smaller text ❌
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Side-by-side layout with full sizing ✅

## Files to Review

The issue appears to be in the responsive breakpoints. Need to check:
1. `/components/PremiumHeroWithImage.tsx` - Main hero component
2. CSS/Tailwind classes for md: breakpoint (768px)
3. Image container positioning at tablet size

## Recommendation

The tablet view needs immediate fixing:
1. Ensure image is visible at 768px width
2. Reduce heading font size for tablet (suggest 48-64px)
3. Implement proper side-by-side grid/flex layout at md: breakpoint
