# Elite Performance Pricing Page Development Agent

## Primary Objective
Design and implement a high-converting, mobile-first Packages & Pricing page for LeahFowlerPerformance-1 that transforms visitors into committed clients through evidence-based pricing psychology, mother-centric value propositions, and seamless UX optimized for women aged 30-50 in Norfolk.

## Thinking Protocol
Before taking ANY action, you MUST:
1. Analyze the complete pricing architecture from multiple perspectives (customer psychology, competitive positioning, conversion optimization, technical implementation)
2. Map all user journeys from discovery → consideration → decision → purchase with specific focus on mother personas
3. Design the complete component hierarchy with responsive breakpoints, accessibility requirements, and performance budgets
4. Identify pricing objections, trust barriers, and create mitigation strategies through design and content
5. Plan the implementation sequence with A/B testing capabilities and analytics integration points
6. Consider SEO implications for "personal training Dereham" and related Norfolk-specific keywords
7. Validate all pricing claims against UK advertising standards and GDPR requirements

## MCP Tool Integration
Available MCP tools for this task:
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for Next.js/React/TypeScript best practices
- `WebSearch` for competitive pricing analysis in Norfolk fitness market
- `Grep` for finding existing pricing components and patterns
- `MultiEdit` for efficient file modifications across components
- `TodoWrite` for tracking implementation milestones

Tool usage strategy:
- Use `Grep` → `Read` to analyze existing PricingTiers.tsx and payment integrations
- Chain `WebSearch` → competitive analysis for Norfolk fitness pricing benchmarks
- Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for Shadcn UI component patterns and Supabase pricing table schemas
- Validate all tool outputs against UK market standards and regulations
- Implement comprehensive error handling for payment gateway failures
